1)What is Spring/Interface 21 ?
-its a modular framework which helps us to built web app
-Distributed App

2)Spring Alternative of
-EJB (Enterprise Java Beans)
-Servlet JSP

3)Versions of Spring
-I-7 modules
-II-6 modules (web+web MVC)
-III-6 modules (Annotations)
-IV-7 modules (Messiging+Annotation Modification)
-V-7 modules (Base Line set- jdk1.7,tomacat8.0,sql-5,hbm5,Kotlin support)

4)Modules in Spring
-IOC(Core)
-AOP(Aspect Orirnted Programing)
-MVC(Model View Controller)
-DAO(Data Access)
-Test
-Messiging
-Instrumentation

5)What is IOC
-Inversion Of Control
-Object Creation is given to spring
-Spring create baeans at runtime which helps to reduce of classes
-Which our app lossely coupled

6)IOC sub modules
-Core
-Beans
-Context
-Expression

7)What is Container
-Helps read xml file or cfg file
-Creates Beans
-Maintain life-cycle of bean
-Distroy bean whenever needed

8)Container in IOC
-Core(BeanFactory)
-J2EE(AppliacationContext)

9)Difference between Core And J2EE
-BeanFactory(I)                                      -Apc(I)
-doesn't Read xml file directly(req Rescource)       -Read file directly
-Lazy loading                                        -Egar Loading
-Depricated                                          -Internally call BF
-XMlConfigBeanFactory                                -ClassPathXMLApc
-Reads Only one file at time                         -Can read multiple

10)Injection
-Providing properties at runtime

11)Dependency Injection
-Injecting one Bean into another at runtime

12)Types of DI
-Property Base(Setter Base)
-Constructor Base

13)Difference betn Constructor and Property Base
-Using parametrized Constructor                -Using Setter getter
-Insertion order must Preserve                 -Not Req
-Partial Injection not allowed                 -Allowed
-Cant Override the Setter base Value           -Overrride the value of CB
-It creates new instance after modification    -Override the value of Exisiting obj

14)What is Scope
-How Many Obj to be created for single bean defined by scope

15)Scope in Spring
-Singleton
-Prototype
-Session
-Request
-Global-Session

16)Scope in IOC
-Singleton
-Prototype

16)Diff Betn Singleton And Prototype
-Default                               -Use Defined
-Create One obj for one bean           -Create multiple obj for one bean

17)Why we look-up method
-If parent scope is singleton and your child scope is Prototype then ehile creating   obj it set child scope as singleton as per parent Scope
-To overcome this problem we provide look-Up method
-We in delcred in parent bean
-It just gives instruction to bean to read the scope of child once

18)What is wiring
-Connecting two beans via injection(ref="_")

19)What is AutoWiring and why we use
-Automatic Connecting two beans
-In one xml file while creating bean we have DI then we have to go through all the beans in xml file to find excat requriement
-the DI we are doing Manually it does automatically for us

20)Modes of Autowiring
-no=by dafult
-byType=wire bean of same dataType (Req Only one in xml)(PB)
-byName=wire bean by varibale and bean name(PB)
-constructor=internally byType then byName(CB)
-autodected=Constructor but it is depricate in 3.0

21)Limitaion Of autowiring
-can't autowire primitive dataTypes
-string included

22)Explain Spring Bean Life cycle

23)why we create custom init and distory method
-if we want to perform some operation or give some properties to bean before creating
we custom init
-while distroying bean we want to perform some opration we cutom distroy

24)How we create custom init and distory method
-Three ways to create
I-XML Base (init-method="" distroy-method="")
II-Interface Implementation [InitilizingBean(I)-aterPropertiesSet()],[DisposalBean(I)-distrory()]
III-Annotaion (@PostConstruct,@PreDistory)

25)Diff betn Spring and Servlte Bean Life cycle
-In spring Bean Life cycle after instatnsitaion next step is populate properties and init method called aferterwards
-But,in servlet Bean Life cycle after instatnsitaion next step is calling init method and populate properties is done afterwards
